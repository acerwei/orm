TO IMPROVE
  - Case (in-)sensitivity
  - Delimiter / Special chars handling (eg. "" '', ``, /\, <>, ,)
  - Trimming and space skipping
  - Error / Exception handling
  - Complex Fields
      - List / Set as Field (Simple)
      - Map as Field (Easy OTM, more work in MTO)
      - Struct / Object as Field (More work)
